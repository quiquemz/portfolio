## Inspired By

This portfolio was inspired by [saadpasta's developerFolio](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio), and I have used the same idea to create a personal portfolio website to demonstrate my skills and knowledge. I sought to create my own portfolio with a similar look and feel, and to showcase my own achievements in a similar manner. I hope that my portfolio provides a clear picture of my abilities as a software developer, and inspires others to create their own portfolios to showcase their skills and experiences.
